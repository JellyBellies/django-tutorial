Django example for StickyWorld

Last update 30/04/2014 

application is called: addressbook (project named: project_sw)

consists of two pages; 
- index which lists all values in database; 
- addrecord containing a form for inputting a new record

no testing or validation included
table is ordered by surname
django-bootstrap3 used for css
sqlite3 used (defualt)

the form could be created by making a class for it, however due to lack of experience and time, I chose to keep it simple and follow the tutorial example.

note: database used to populate drop down menus on form (save space but more processing power as a result of the query)
